# ProjectEuler
Hello! This GitHub repository is holding my personal solutions to questions from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) almost exclusively written in Python 
using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library with detailed explanations! I hope my solutions can 
help you learn how to solve math problems through coding and hopefully inspre you
to try out some of your own!
