# ProjectEuler
Hello! This GitHub repo is my personal set of solutions to
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. For each question 
there is (or will be!) a solution written in:
* Python
* NumPy
* Java 
* Rust
* Julia 

Additionally there are explanations of the algorithm, method and code 
used to solve each question. The table below shows the status of solution 
for each problem.

My in depth explanations can be found on my Notion Page!
