"""
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
So the 7th triangle number would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28
The first ten terms would be:
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
    
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
    1: 1
    3: 1,3
    6: 1,2,3,6
   10: 1,2,5,10
   15: 1,3,5,15
   21: 1,3,7,21
   28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
 
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
