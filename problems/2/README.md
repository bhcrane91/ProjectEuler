### Problem Statement:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Explanantion
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as $f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_{n}$, with $f_0=0, f_1=1$.
Lets define $S(N)$ as our sum over $F(n)$ as the function we are summing over, where $N$ is the target bound for the sequence, and $F(n,N)$ is a piecewise function.
$$
F(n,N) =
\begin{cases} 
f_n & \text{if } (f_n\mod 2)=0, f_n \lt N
 \\
0 & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$ 
$$
S(N) = \sum_{n} F(n,N)
$$

In simpler terms, we really just need to keep track of the most recently calculated Fibonacci term and only include it in our sum if it is even. This requires two pointers for the most recent terms of the sequence, and a temporary value used to update the terms. Start with 
$$
f_0 = a = 0, f_1 = b = 1, S=0, N=4000000
$$
Check if b, our most recent term, is even (its not). Add to our sum.
$$
F(1,4000000) =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } (1\mod 2)=0, 2 \lt 4000000
 \\
0 & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$ 
The first case is not satisfied, so we add $0$ to our sum and update our terms. Now:
$$
f_1 = a = 1, f_2 = b = 1, S=0, N=4000000 \\
F(2,4000000) =
\begin{cases} 
2 & \text{if } (2\mod 2)=0, 2 \lt 4000000
 \\
0 & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
The first case is now satisfied so we add $2$ to our sum and continue.
$$
f_2 = a = 2, f_3 = b = 3, S=2, N=4000000
$$
We continue this process while $b \lt N$ and return $S$ as our answer.
