"""
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: f(n) = n^2 + n + 41
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
values 0 <= n <= 39. 

However, when n = 40: 
40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when 
n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes
for the consecutive values 0 <= n <= 79. The product of the coefficients, 
-79 and 1601, is -126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:
f(n) = n^2 + an + b
, where |a| < 1000 and |b| <= 1000
where |n|is the modulus/absolute value of n
e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression 
that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
